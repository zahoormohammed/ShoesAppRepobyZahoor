Display informative error messages to guide users in providing correct information.
Improved Modals:

Enhance the modals for adding and editing items with a more user-friendly design.
Include validation checks and clear feedback when saving or updating data.
Cart Functionality:

Implement a dedicated cart screen for users to review and manage selected items.
Allow users to adjust quantities, remove items, and view the total cost in the cart.
Persistent User Data:

Store user-specific data securely, such as cart items and preferences.
Utilize a database solution like Firebase Firestore or a local database for persistence.
Search and Filtering:

Add search functionality to quickly find specific items in the inventory.
Implement filters or sorting options to organize and display items based on different criteria.
Unit Testing:

Develop comprehensive unit tests using Jest to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
Test critical functionalities, edge cases, and user interactions.
Error Handling:

Deployment and Distribution:

Set up continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
Distribute the app through app stores (Google Play Store and Apple App Store) for a broader audience.
Performance Optimization:

Optimize app performance by analyzing and improving code efficiency.
Implement lazy loading for components and images to reduce initial loading times.
By addressing these areas, the Shoes App can become a more robust, user-friendly, and feature-rich application. The specific improvements to prioritize may depend on the target audience and the overall goals of the application.
